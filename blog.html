Architecture was supposed to be my
world, lines, rulers, elevations,
all that. But somewhere along the
way, I realized that the creativity
I loved didn’t have to stay on paper.
It could move. It could breathe. It
could become a game.

Transferring to a tech school felt
like jumping into a whole new universe.
New hallways, new courses, new faces,
and yes, a little bit of fear. What if
I wasn’t good enough? What if I didn’t
fit in? What if this wasn’t really for
me?

Turns out, I didn’t need to worry. The
moment I stepped into Game Development,
I met the best classmates I could’ve
asked for. The kind who laugh with you,
help you, hype you up, share their
snacks, stay with you during stressful
code moments, and celebrate even the
smallest wins. The kind of people who
turn a confusing lesson into a fun one
and make school feel less like a
requirement and more like a community.

With them, studying doesn’t feel heavy.
Learning feels exciting. Even debugging
feels… okay (sometimes). And every day,
I find myself actually looking forward
to going to school — to grow, to create,
and just to be around people who make
the journey worth it.

Architecture taught me structure. Game
development is teaching me imagination
with no boundaries. And my classmates? 
They’re teaching me that the right
people can transform any path you
choose.

I’m genuinely excited for the rest of
the school year — to study, learn,
laugh, and build memories with them.
If this is what the start looks like,
I can’t wait to see what the rest of
the journey holds.

                <br>
                <pre class="card-text">
If there’s one thing I learned recently,
it’s this: making a website as a complete
beginner is way harder than it looks.

When you first hear “Make a simple
website” you imagine something easy,drag,
drop, maybe type a few things. But the
moment you see HTML brackets, CSS curly
braces, and random thing called “divs”
it suddenly feels like you’ve entered a
secret coding universe that everyone
understands except you.

At the start, I honestly had no idea
what I was doing. What’s a margin? Why
won’t my text go to the center? Why does
everything keep moving when I resize the
window? Why does one small mistake break
the entire page?

Every time I fixed something, something
else would break. I’d change one line of
code and boom, my layout explodes.
Buttons fly to the corner. Images stretch
like noodles. The footer refuses to stay
at the bottom. It was chaos.

And don’t get me started on CSS. CSS
feels like arguing with a stubborn deity
that only listens sometimes. You think
you’re writing something  correct, but
then nothing happens. Or everything
happen but not the thing you wanted.

But here’s the thing:Even though its
difficult, confusing, and sometimes
frustrating, it’s also… exciting.
Every small win feels huge. When you
finally get a layout right, center
something perfectly, or make your
webpage look even a little bit like
a “real website,” you feel proud,
because you did that.

Little by little, the code starts to
make sense. Things you struggled with
yesterday suddenly click today. And
you realize you’re learning something
powerful, something you couldn’t
imagine yourself doing before.

Building a website as a complete
beginner is not easy. It takes
patience. It takes trying, failing,
Googling, trying again, and failing
again. But each struggle is part of
the progress. And now, looking at the
website I'm building, even if it's
not perfect, I can say one thing: I
may have started with zero knowledge,
but I'm learning, and everyline of
code is proof of that.

                <h3 class="card-title">The Best Experience of My Life: Meeting My Class</h3>
                <br>
                <pre class="card-text">
If I had to choose the best experience 
I’ve had so far, it wouldn’t be a trip,
an event,  or an achievement. It would be
something simple  but meaningful meeting
the people in my class.
                
I didn’t expect anything special when 
the school year started. I thought it
would just be another set of faces,
another group I’d work with for a few
months. But I was wrong. These people
quickly became more than classmates,
they became friends I genuinely care
about, the kind who make every day
lighter, funnier, and more memorable.

What surprised me most is how 
comfortable everything felt. We
connected naturally, shared jokes
instantly, and supported each other
even when things got stressful.
Whether it’s helping with assignments,
laughing over random topics,
struggling through lessons  together,
or just talking about life, they’ve
made school feel like a place I
actually look forward to.

It’s rare to meet a group that makes
you feel welcome the moment you step
in. A group that celebrates your wins,
understands your struggles, and makes
even the most tiring days feel
meaningful. And somehow, that’s exactly
what I found.

Honestly, meeting them is one of the
best things that has ever happened to
me. They’re the kind of people who make
the journey worth it — and I’m grateful
that I get to spend this school year
learning, growing, and experiencing life
with them.
